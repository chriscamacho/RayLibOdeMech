# RayLibOdeMech
demonstrates using OpenDE and Raylib together

Please read the doxygen docs!

Why ODE it's OLD and not C++

Well it actually is written in C++, it has a stable (C) API and few bugs,
because a project is feature complete doesn't mean its abandoned

If used properly ODE produces stable sims with decent performance

Did I mention the API is stable...

(I have literally come back to projects years later and not needed to
rewrite because some parameters of even whole functions have changed
been removed etc)


Please read the doxygen docs, the main page details important
setup steps you must do

when running the examples run them from the root of the project ie

bin/fountain

(don't cd into bin first!)


please feel free to get in touch via bedroomcoders.co.uk

did I mention there are doxygen docs ?


Enjoy!
